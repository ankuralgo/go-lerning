Loop

For finite loop
for <pre statement> ; <expression> ; <post statement> {
    <code>
}

For finite loop with range

for i := range attrList {
    <code>
}

attrt list here is a list of any data type list list of numbers or list of Strings

For without expression creates an infinite loop

for {
    <code>
}
