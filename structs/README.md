Capturing my Golang learning programs 
I followed Nigel Poulton on pluralsight for my learning.

Structs


Basic types:
- boolean
- int
- float
- string

Reference type:
- slice
- map
- function

Specialized Type
- struct

Struct example:

type circle struct {
    r float64 
    d float64 
    c float64 
    name string
}

There is no comparison between struct and class. 

Object oriented programming
Go does not support class, object, and inheritance
