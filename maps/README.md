Maps
- Key value pair
- Key sorted list 
- Iterating with range loop it may return randomly
- Maps are reference type
- Good to provide map se
- Not thread safe



map [<key-type>] <value-type>
eg. map[string] int
Key-type has to be comparable type (works with == and !=), doesn not include slices and functions
Keys must be unique
